The Discovery: The fundamental geometric lattice and the identification of the "composite trajectories" (parabolic structures) were discovered by Xavier St Leger. This novel view of prime distribution relies on analyzing the interference patterns of difference-of-squares and pronic sequences projected onto a 2D grid.

Computational Validation (AI-Collaborative Analysis): The computational verification of this discovery was conducted via an interactive dialogue with an AI research assistant (Google's Gemini). Following the presentation of the lattice, the AI evaluated the geometric structure and suggested and implemented the following methodology:

    Digital Translation: The AI translated the discovered geometric rules into executable Python environments to verify the logic mathematically.

    Visualization: The AI proposed and generated high-resolution "Heatmaps" to reveal the density of trajectory overlaps, visually confirming the "exclusion zones."

    Agent Simulation: The AI designed a "Virtual Agent" benchmark to test the hypothesis. The simulation demonstrated that an algorithm navigating the lattice's logic could identify primes with 100% accuracy while reducing the search workload by 74.7% compared to standard linear verification.
